Beyond an interesting piece of trivia, it has substantial importance in graph embeddings: many graph embeddings learn the graph structure by following the &amp;lsquo;friendship ties&amp;rsquo; (or edges), which preferentially leads itself to high-degree nodes. How does this bias toward high-degree nodes impact on the generated embedding? Here, we find an overlooked built-in debiasing feature of word2vec that happens to negate the bias due to the friendship paradox.</description></item><item><title>Contact tracing</title><link>https://skojaku.github.io/research/contact-tracing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>skojaku@iu.edu (Sadamori Kojaku)</author><guid>https://skojaku.github.io/research/contact-tracing/</guid><description>A potent tool for discovery and control of epidemic spreading is contact tracing. Contact tracing has shown its effectiveness in epidemic outbreaks including Ebola, SARS, and COVID-19. Yet, it has not been clear what makes contact tracing highly effective.
We show that the effectiveness of contact tracing is largely attributed to two independent biases in the process of disease spreading and tracing contacts. The first bias arises when a disease is transmitted through contact ties.</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>https://skojaku.github.io/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:30:08 +1000</pubDate><author>skojaku@iu.edu (Sadamori Kojaku)</author><guid>https://skojaku.github.io/publications/</guid><description>CV 履歴書 Google Scholar Preprints Dakota Murray, Jisung Yoon, Sadamori Kojaku, Rodrigo Costas, Woo-Sung Jung, Staša Milojević, Yong-Yeol Ah [Preprint]] Journal papers and conference proceedings (refereed) Sadamori Kojaku, Jisung Yoon, Isabel Constantino, and Yong-Yeol Ahn.

Although simple to state for physical experiments, measuring people is notoriously difficult, in part because people change actions in response to measurement.
Scientists are measured in many ways, e.g., # of publications, citations, h-index, and to name a few.</description></item><item><title>Code &amp; Data</title><link>https://skojaku.github.io/code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:30:08 +1000</pubDate><author>skojaku@iu.edu (Sadamori Kojaku)</author><guid>https://skojaku.github.io/code/</guid><description>All my code can be found in Github

Core-periphery structure has been found in various empirical networks such as social networks, biological networks and transportation networks [1, 2]. Many studies have assumed that networks consist of one core and one periphery. However, networks may contain multiple core-periphery pairs.
We developed an algorithm to find multiple core-periphery pairs in networks [3].</description></item><item><title>Constructing networks from correlation matrices</title><link>https://skojaku.github.io/research/correlation-matrix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:27:37 +1000</pubDate><author>skojaku@iu.edu (Sadamori Kojaku)</author><guid>https://skojaku.github.io/research/correlation-matrix/</guid><description>Many networks of scientific interest have been constructed from correlation matrices. Examples include protein interaction networks, gene co-expression networks, functional brain networks, climate networks and asset graphs. In correlation networks, the edges indicate nontrivial correlations between the features of the nodes. A widely accepted approach for constructing networks from correlation matrices is the thresholding; one places an edge between two nodes if the correlation is larger than a threshold. However, the thresholding may induce spurious edges in the generated networks because a large correlation may be induced by a factor irrelevant to the node pair such as a global trend and pseudo correlations.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://skojaku.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:30:08 +1000</pubDate><author>skojaku@iu.edu (Sadamori Kojaku)</author><guid>https://skojaku.github.io/about/</guid><description>Sadamori Kojaku Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, Indiana University Bloomington
