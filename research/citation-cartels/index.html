These indicators appear to be hard, sound neutral and give an air of objectivity, and are considered as a proxy for ``scientific excellence&rsquo;'. These indicators are indispensable for research assessment for grants and tenure, creating an ever-increasing pressure to maintain high-performance indicators. As such, some scientists game the system by artificially boosting citations.</p><p>Self-citations are a simple and famous practice to increase citations, although self-citations can be easily detected. A less detectable form of citation malpractice is <em>citation cartel</em>.</p><p>A citation cartel is a group of scientists who informally agree to cite with each other. Because it involves multiple scientists, identifying citation cartels is notoriously challenging, and little is known about this phenomenon itself.</p><p>Here, we put forward an algorithm, CIDRE, to find anomalous citation groups in citation networks. With CIDRE, we systematically explore the anomalous citation behavior of journals. CIDRE detected more than half of known groups of journals suspended from Journal Citation Reports along with numerous new journal groups with anomalous citation patterns.</p><h1 id=paper--code>Paper & Code<a href=#paper--code class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p><a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93572-3>[Paper]</a> [<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09097>Preprint</a>], [<a href=https://github.com/skojaku/cidre>Code</a>], [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12QkfRUMWFzxSPq2tC53DQ9Ek4RYuxJEx/view?usp=sharing">Slide</a>]</p><div style="padding:62.5% 0 0;position:relative"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/582302595?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479&h=8e5a0ba380" frameborder=0 allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100% title="Detecting anomalous citation groups in journal networks"></iframe></div><script src=https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js></script></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2021 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
