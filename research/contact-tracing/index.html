Contact tracing has shown its effectiveness in epidemic outbreaks including Ebola, SARS, and COVID-19.
Yet, it has not been clear what makes contact tracing highly effective.</p><p>We show that the effectiveness of contact tracing is largely attributed to two independent biases in the process of disease spreading and tracing contacts.
The first bias arises when a disease is transmitted through contact ties.
Namely, a disease is <em>k</em> times more likely to reach a person with $k$ contacts than someone with one contact because the person is exposed to <em>k</em> times more people.
Another bias comes into play when we trace the disease pathway <em>backward</em>, i.e., when tracing back to the source of infection, a person infecting <em>k</em> individuals is <em>k</em> times more likely to be traced than someone infecting one individual.
These two biases are independent of each other, making backward contact tracing highly effective, i.e., a person infecting <em>k</em> individuals is k square times more likely to be traced by backward tracing.
Using synthetic and high-resolution temporal contact datasets, we showed that backward contact tracing can prevent a substantial fraction of transmission with high efficiency in terms of the number of prevented infections per isolation.</p><p>Backward tracing can be performed anything that spreads through edges in networks to identify the source of spreading. For example, we may trace back the source of the scientific idea that had spread from one field to another through citations, or the source of misinformation that spreads from one person to another through social media.</p><p><strong>Figure</strong>: Backward contact tracing is highly effective in curbing pandemics thanks
to two biases arising from disease spreading and contact tracing processes.
<strong>A</strong>. Disease spreads through contact ties, reaching preferentially to people with many contacts.
<strong>B</strong>. By tracing the disease pathway backward, backward tracing is likely to reach superspreaders who spread the disease to many.
The two biases are at play independently of each other, making the backward contact tracing highly effective.
<strong>C</strong>. Using synthetic and empirical contact datasets, we showed that a small amount of backward tracing can prevent a substantial number of infections.</p><h1 id=paper--code>Paper & Code<a href=#paper--code class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>[<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01187-2>Paper</a>], [<a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02362>Preprint</a>], [<a href=https://github.com/yy/backward-contact-tracing>Code</a>]<a name=scola-ref></a></p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2021 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
