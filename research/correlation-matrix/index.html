In correlation networks, the edges indicate nontrivial correlations between the features of the nodes.
A widely accepted approach for constructing networks from correlation matrices is the thresholding; one places an edge between two nodes if the correlation is larger than a threshold.
However, the thresholding may induce spurious edges in the generated networks because a large correlation may be induced by a factor irrelevant to the node pair such as a global trend and pseudo correlations.
An example is a large correlation between ice cream sale and murder rate; people buy more ice cream and interact with more people when it is hotter.</p><p>We developed an algorithm for constructing networks from correlation matrices, which we refer to as <a href=https://scola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>Scola</a>.
A key feature of the algorithm is to use the null models for correlation matrices, based on which we decide whether to place edges between nodes or not.
In other words, we place edges between nodes whose correlations are <em>unexpected</em> for the null models.
Users can run the algorithm with a null model of interest or let the algorithm to choose statistically the best null model among candidate null models.
For three economic data, the algorithm produces statistically better networks and more accurately predicts country-level product export volumes.</p><p><strong>Figure</strong>:
Sample correlation matrices and networks for the product space data.
The solid lines inside the matrices indicate the boundary between year <em>t</em> (first half) and year <em>t</em>+10 (second half).
The node colour indicates the product type.
The value of the PRODY index averaged over the nodes in the same type is shown in the parentheses.</p><h1 id=paper--code>Paper & Code<a href=#paper--code class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>[<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2019.0578?af=R">Paper</a>], [<a href=https://github.com/skojaku/scola>Code</a>]</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2021 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
