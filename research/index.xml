Contact tracing has shown its effectiveness in epidemic outbreaks including Ebola, SARS, and COVID-19.
Yet, it has not been clear what makes contact tracing highly effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We show that the effectiveness of contact tracing is largely attributed to two independent biases in the process of disease spreading and tracing contacts.
The first bias arises when a disease is transmitted through contact ties.
Namely, a disease is &lt;em>k&lt;/em> times more likely to reach a person with $k$ contacts than someone with one contact because the person is exposed to &lt;em>k&lt;/em> times more people.
Another bias comes into play when we trace the disease pathway &lt;em>backward&lt;/em>, i.e., when tracing back to the source of infection, a person infecting &lt;em>k&lt;/em> individuals is &lt;em>k&lt;/em> times more likely to be traced than someone infecting one individual.
These two biases are independent of each other, making backward contact tracing highly effective, i.e., a person infecting &lt;em>k&lt;/em> individuals is k square times more likely to be traced by backward tracing.
Using synthetic and high-resolution temporal contact datasets, we showed that backward contact tracing can prevent a substantial fraction of transmission with high efficiency in terms of the number of prevented infections per isolation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Backward tracing can be performed anything that spreads through edges in networks to identify the source of spreading. For example, we may trace back the source of the scientific idea that had spread from one field to another through citations, or the source of misinformation that spreads from one person to another through social media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Figure&lt;/strong>: Backward contact tracing is highly effective in curbing pandemics thanks
to two biases arising from disease spreading and contact tracing processes.
&lt;strong>A&lt;/strong>. Disease spreads through contact ties, reaching preferentially to people with many contacts.
&lt;strong>B&lt;/strong>. By tracing the disease pathway backward, backward tracing is likely to reach superspreaders who spread the disease to many.
The two biases are at play independently of each other, making the backward contact tracing highly effective.
&lt;strong>C&lt;/strong>. Using synthetic and empirical contact datasets, we showed that a small amount of backward tracing can prevent a substantial number of infections.&lt;/p>

Although simple to state for physical experiments, measuring people is notoriously difficult, in part because people change actions in response to measurement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scientists are measured in many ways, e.g., # of publications, citations, h-index, and to name a few. These indicators appear to be hard, sound neutral and give an air of objectivity, and are considered as a proxy for ``scientific excellence&amp;rsquo;'. These indicators are indispensable for research assessment for grants and tenure, creating an ever-increasing pressure to maintain high-performance indicators. As such, some scientists game the system by artificially boosting citations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Self-citations are a simple and famous practice to increase citations, although self-citations can be easily detected. A less detectable form of citation malpractice is &lt;em>citation cartel&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A citation cartel is a group of scientists who informally agree to cite with each other. Because it involves multiple scientists, identifying citation cartels is notoriously challenging, and little is known about this phenomenon itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, we put forward an algorithm, CIDRE, to find anomalous citation groups in citation networks. With CIDRE, we systematically explore the anomalous citation behavior of journals. CIDRE detected more than half of known groups of journals suspended from Journal Citation Reports along with numerous new journal groups with anomalous citation patterns.&lt;/p>

Core-periphery structure has been found in various empirical networks such as social networks, biological networks and transportation networks [1, 2].
Many studies have assumed that networks consist of one core and one periphery.
However, networks may contain multiple core-periphery pairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We developed an algorithm to find multiple core-periphery pairs in networks [3].
In the political blog network [4] shown in Fig. 1, the algorithm found two core-periphery pairs, each of which consists of the blogs sharing the same political agenda.
We applied this algorithm or its variant to an inter-bank trade network [5], a maritime transportation network [6] and a short-text classification task [7].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also showed that heterogeneous degree distributions alone explain single core-periphery structure [8]. In other words, when one says that a network is composed of a single core and a single periphery, hubs (i.e. nodes with large degrees, or the number of edges) are core nodes and nodes with small degrees are peripheral nodes. We proved that a core-periphery structure that is not merely explained by heterogeneous degree distributions necessarily involves at least three blocks of nodes. An example is a combination of a single core, a single periphery and a community, which yields three blocks. Another example is two core-periphery pairs, which yields four blocks in total. Based on this result, we extended our first algorithm [7] to find multiple core-periphery pairs in networks that are not merely explained by heterogeneous degree distributions [8].
The extended algorithm allows one to find small-degree core nodes and large-degree peripheral nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Figure&lt;/strong>: Two core-periphery pairs in the political blog network detected by our algorithm.
The filled or open circles indicate core nodes or peripheral nodes, respectively.
The colour of each circle indicates the core-periphery pair to which the node belongs.
The open circles with a grey border indicate nodes that do not belong to any core-periphery pair.&lt;/p>

A widely accepted approach for constructing networks from correlation matrices is the thresholding; one places an edge between two nodes if the correlation is larger than a threshold.
However, the thresholding may induce spurious edges in the generated networks because a large correlation may be induced by a factor irrelevant to the node pair such as a global trend and pseudo correlations.
An example is a large correlation between ice cream sale and murder rate; people buy more ice cream and interact with more people when it is hotter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We developed an algorithm for constructing networks from correlation matrices, which we refer to as &lt;a href="https://scola.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Scola&lt;/a>.
A key feature of the algorithm is to use the null models for correlation matrices, based on which we decide whether to place edges between nodes or not.
In other words, we place edges between nodes whose correlations are &lt;em>unexpected&lt;/em> for the null models.
Users can run the algorithm with a null model of interest or let the algorithm to choose statistically the best null model among candidate null models.
For three economic data, the algorithm produces statistically better networks and more accurately predicts country-level product export volumes.&lt;/p>
